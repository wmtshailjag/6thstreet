1. Add `gender` to global state
2. Replace PDP and PLP context

## Missing data

1. Algolia brands endpoint does not contain the link to a brand category
2. Link to Product in PLP response (bad for SEO)
3. Allowed countries - take from Magento 2 ?
4. Icons and titles of countries are missing
5. Where are gender sources?
6. Homepage, Categories dynamic-content data does not match one format
7. Filters logic is unclear, architecture?
